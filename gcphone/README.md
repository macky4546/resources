Take from the original resource and modified to work with Qbus based servers.


------------

# IMPORTANT INFORMATION

# ALL MY SCRIPT ARE FREE AND OPENSOURCE.

## Adapted to work with Core_Dispatch

I found a fix to the Nil values in the server console, it happened because when we are in the selection menu, the resource want an id, at that momento we dont have that, so the fix i found is going to the rs-spawn (qb-spawn) in this part https://prnt.sc/wdv3av  put the trigger event in this case is  TriggerEvent('gcphone:FixOnLoad)  like the image.

### Thanks to TechnoBehemoth and MadRP for the help fixing some bugs,

 * MenuV from Tigo https://github.com/ThymonA/menuv

Change in the config.lua the discord WEBHOOK << # IF YOU DONT CHANGE THIS THE PICTURE FAIL AND CRASH

REMEMBER THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS SO EXPECT SOME BUGS


F.A.Q
* Can you convert X resource?
  - No sorry i don´t do commits
  
* Why free?
  - This is not my resource so i cann´t take money from you, if you like the work buy me a coffe, or better support the developers.
  
* xDope say that you are trying to stealth scripts.
  - Coming from a "developer" who doesn't know how to dump an obfuscated code or just PM me and ask i say, fuck him, remember he SELL script so maybe he donest like free stuff
 
 * Why the obfuscation?
  - i see some people who doesn't give credits to me or my work, and just hide the resource behind a paywall so i protect the code and print in the console where you can find stuff.


All the credits go to Crew if you are the owner just pm me and i will dete it.
If you are a "developer" of certain framework that claim this is your work.... poor dude.... i hide some stuff lets see if you find it...
